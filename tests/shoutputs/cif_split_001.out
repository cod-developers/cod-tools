  Single crystals were grown from the evaporation of a saturated pentane
  solution at room temperature.  Two of the angles of the unit cell were
  close to 90ø and attempts were made to use the monoclinic cell.  In this
  cell, the merging R was exceedingly large and the structure could not be
  refined.
 
  Refinement of F^2^ against ALL reflections.  The weighted R-factor wR and 
  goodness of fit S are based on F^2^, conventional R-factors R are based 
  on F, with F set to zero for negative F^2^. The threshold expression of 
  F^2^ > 2sigma(F^2^) is used only for calculating R-factors(gt) etc. and is 
  not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement.  R-factors based 
  on F^2^ are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R- 
  factors based on ALL data will be even larger.

  Single crystals were grown from the diffusion of pentane into saturated
  dichloromethane solution at -30ø.  Several of the t-butyl group occupied
  two distinct orientations with site occupancy factors of 0.6667 and 0.3333,
  respectively.  The pentane solvate was severely disordered and
  dichloromethane solvates were disordered, and they were removed
  ("squeezed") from the data by the Platon for Windows software program.

  Single crystals were grown from the slow evaporation of a saturated
  chloroform solution at -35øC. One of the tert-butyl groups exhibited
  large thermal motion and two of the carbon atoms were each refined in
  two distinct positions.  One chloroform was located in the asymmetric
  unit.  It was disordered in several orientations and was removed
  ("squeezed") from the data by the Platon for Windows software program.
