<abstract>The synthesis of two pyridylamidinate bis(N,N'-bis(trimethylsilyl)-2-pyridylamidinate)An(Î¼-Cl)2Li(TMEDA) (An = U (), Th ()) complexes is presented. For complex the solid state X-ray structures were studied and compared to that of complex . The organoactinide complexes were studied as pre-catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene when activated by methylalumoxane (MAO). The catalytic activity was improved using a mixture of trityl tetrakispentafluorophenylborate (TTPB) and a small amount of methylalumoxane (MAO) as cocatalysts, and was amazingly improved, providing the greatest activity, using only triisobutyl aluminum (TIBA). We present a combination of ESR, C60 radical trapping, and MALDI-TOF studies describing the formation of the single-site active species, capturing some unique features of the complexes and shedding light on the polymerization mechanism.</abstract>
