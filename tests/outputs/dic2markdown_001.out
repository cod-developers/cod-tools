# ATTRIBUTES


     This category is parent of all other categories in the DDLm
     dictionary.

## ALIAS


     The attributes used to specify the aliased names of definitions.

### \_alias.definition\_id


     Identifier tag of an aliased definition.

### \_alias.deprecation\_date


     Date that the aliased tag was deprecated as a definition tag.

### \_alias.dictionary\_uri


     Dictionary URI in which the aliased definition belongs.

## CATEGORY


     The attributes used to specify the properties of a
     "category" of data items.

### \_category.key\_id


     Tag of a single data item in a Loop category which is the generic key
     to access other items in the category. The value of this
     item must be unique in order to provide unambiguous access to
     a packet (row) in the table of values.  This may be assumed to be a function
     of the datanames listed in category_key.name.

### CATEGORY\_KEY


     The attributes used to specify (possibly multiple) 
     keys for a given category.

#### \_category\_key.name


     A minimal list of tag(s) that together constitute a compound key
     to access other items in a Loop category. In other words, the combined values of the
     datanames listed in this loop must be unique, so that unambiguous access 
     to a packet (row) in the table of values is possible.  The dataname associated with
     category.key_id is only included in this loop if no other set of datanames can form
     a compound key.
