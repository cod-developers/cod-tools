scripts/cif_molecule: tests/cases/cif_molecule_042.inp data_9008564: ERROR, the maximum number of polymer atom repetitions 100 was hit for the atom C (1)
To get around this limit, please increase --max-polymer-atoms, to say, --max-polymer-atoms=200 or decrease --max-polymer-span (e.g. --max-polymer-span=2, but expect increased computation times and memory consumption).
