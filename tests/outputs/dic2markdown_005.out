## CATEGORY\_OVERVIEW

## ATOM\_SITE

Data items in the ATOM\_SITE category record details about
 the atom sites in a crystal structure, such as the positional
 coordinates, atomic displacement parameters, and magnetic moments
 and directions.

### \_atom\_site\_adp\_type

A standard code used to describe the type of atomic displacement
 parameters used for the site.

Values:

<table>
  <tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Uani</td><td>anisotropic Uij</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Uiso</td><td>isotropic U</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Uovl</td><td>overall U</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Umpe</td><td>multipole expansion U</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Bani</td><td>anisotropic Bij</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Biso</td><td>isotropic B</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Bovl</td><td>overall B</td></tr>
</table>
### \_atom\_site\_aniso\_B\_11

These are the standard anisotropic atomic displacement
 components in angstroms squared which appear in the 
 structure-factor term

 T = exp{-(1/4) sum~i~ [ sum~j~ (B^ij^ h~i~ h~j~ a\*~i~ a\*~j~) ] }

 h = the Miller indices
 a\* = the reciprocal-space cell lengths

 The unique elements of the real symmetric matrix are
 entered by row.

 The IUCr Commission on Nomenclature recommends against the use
 of B for reporting atomic displacement parameters. U, being
 directly proportional to B, is preferred.

Units: angstroms squared

### \_atom\_site\_aniso\_label

Anisotropic atomic displacement parameters are usually looped in
 a separate list. If this is the case, this code must match the
 \_atom\_site\_label of the associated atom in the atom coordinate
 list and conform with the same rules described in
 \_atom\_site\_label.

### \_atom\_site\_aniso\_ratio

Ratio of the maximum to minimum principal axes of
 displacement (thermal) ellipsoids.

### \_atom\_site\_aniso\_type\_symbol

This \_atom\_type\_symbol code links the anisotropic atom
 parameters to the atom-type data associated with this site and
 must match one of the \_atom\_type\_symbol codes in this list.

### \_atom\_site\_aniso\_U\_11

These are the standard anisotropic atomic displacement
 components in angstroms squared which appear in the
 structure-factor term

 T = exp{-2pi^2^ sum~i~ [sum~j~ (U^ij^ h~i~ h~j~ a\*~i~ a\*~j~) ] }

 h = the Miller indices
 a\* = the reciprocal-space cell lengths

 The unique elements of the real symmetric matrix are
 entered by row.

Units: angstroms squared

### \_atom\_site\_attached\_hydrogens

The number of hydrogen atoms attached to the atom at this site
 excluding any hydrogen atoms for which coordinates (measured or
 calculated) are given.

### \_atom\_site\_B\_equiv\_geom\_mean

Equivalent isotropic atomic displacement parameter, B(equiv),
 in angstroms squared, calculated as the geometric mean of
 the anisotropic atomic displacement parameters.

 B(equiv) = (B~i~ B~j~ B~k~)^1/3^

 B~n~  = the principal components of the orthogonalized B^ij^

 The IUCr Commission on Nomenclature recommends against the use
 of B for reporting atomic displacement parameters. U, being
 directly proportional to B, is preferred.

Units: angstroms squared

### \_atom\_site\_B\_iso\_or\_equiv

Isotropic atomic displacement parameter, or equivalent isotropic
 atomic displacement parameter, B(equiv), in angstroms squared,
 calculated from anisotropic displacement components.

 B(equiv) = (1/3) sum~i~[sum~j~(B^ij^ a\*~i~ a\*~j~ a~i~ a~j~)]

 a     = the real-space cell lengths
 a\*    = the reciprocal-space cell lengths
 B^ij^ = 8 pi^2^ U^ij^

 Ref: Fischer, R. X. &amp; Tillmanns, E. (1988). Acta Cryst. C44,
      775-776.

 The IUCr Commission on Nomenclature recommends against the use
 of B for reporting atomic displacement parameters. U, being
 directly proportional to B, is preferred.

Units: angstroms squared

### \_atom\_site\_calc\_attached\_atom

The \_atom\_site\_label of the atom site to which the &#39;geometry-
 calculated&#39; atom site is attached.

### \_atom\_site\_calc\_flag

A standard code to signal whether the site coordinates have been
 determined from the intensities or calculated from the geometry
 of surrounding sites, or have been assigned dummy coordinates.
 The abbreviation &#39;c&#39; may be used in place of &#39;calc&#39;.

Values:

<table>
  <tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>d</td><td>determined from diffraction measurements</td></tr>
  <tr><td>calc</td><td>calculated from molecular geometry</td></tr>
  <tr><td>c</td><td>abbreviation for &quot;calc&quot;</td></tr>
  <tr><td>dum</td><td>dummy site with meaningless coordinates</td></tr>
</table>
### \_atom\_site\_Cartn\_x

The atom-site coordinates in angstroms specified according to a
 set of orthogonal Cartesian axes related to the cell axes as
 specified by the \_atom\_sites\_Cartn\_transform\_axes description.

Units: angstroms

### \_atom\_site\_chemical\_conn\_number

This number links an atom site to the chemical connectivity list.
 It must match a number specified by \_chemical\_conn\_atom\_number.

### \_atom\_site\_constraints

A description of the constraints applied to parameters at this
 site during refinement. See also \_atom\_site\_refinement\_flags
 and \_refine\_ls\_number\_constraints.

### \_atom\_site\_description

A description of special aspects of this site. See also
 \_atom\_site\_refinement\_flags.

### \_atom\_site\_disorder\_assembly

A code which identifies a cluster of atoms that show long-range
 positional disorder but are locally ordered. Within each such
 cluster of atoms, \_atom\_site\_disorder\_group is used to identify
 the sites that are simultaneously occupied. This field is only
 needed if there is more than one cluster of disordered atoms
 showing independent local order.

### \_atom\_site\_disorder\_group

A code which identifies a group of positionally disordered atom
 sites that are locally simultaneously occupied. Atoms that are
 positionally disordered over two or more sites (e.g. the hydrogen
 atoms of a methyl group that exists in two orientations) can
 be assigned to two or more groups. Sites belonging to the same
 group are simultaneously occupied, but those belonging to
 different groups are not. A minus prefix (e.g. &quot;-1&quot;) is used to
 indicate sites disordered about a special position.

### \_atom\_site\_fract\_x

Atom-site coordinates as fractions of the \_cell\_length\_ values.

### \_atom\_site\_label

The \_atom\_site\_label is a unique identifier for a particular site
 in the crystal. This code is made up of a sequence of up to seven
 components, \_atom\_site\_label\_component\_0 to \*\_6, which may be
 specified as separate data items. Component 0 usually matches one
 of the specified \_atom\_type\_symbol codes. This is not mandatory
 if an \_atom\_site\_type\_symbol item is included in the atom-site
 list. The \_atom\_site\_type\_symbol always takes precedence over
 an \_atom\_site\_label in the identification of the atom type. The
 label components 1 to 6 are optional, and normally only
 components 0 and 1 are used. Note that components 0 and 1 are
 concatenated, while all other components, if specified, are
 separated by an underscore. Underscores are
 only used if higher-order components exist. If an intermediate
 component is not used, it may be omitted provided the underscore
 separators are inserted. For example, the label &#39;C233\_\_ggg&#39; is
 acceptable and represents the components C, 233, &#39;&#39; and ggg.
 Different labels may have a different number of components.

### \_atom\_site\_label\_component\_0

Component 0 is normally a code which matches identically with
 one of the \_atom\_type\_symbol codes. If this is the case, then the
 rules governing the \_atom\_type\_symbol code apply. If, however,
 the data item \_atom\_site\_type\_symbol is also specified in the
 atom-site list, component 0 need not match this symbol or adhere
 to any of the \_atom\_type\_symbol rules.
 Component 1 is referred to as the &quot;atom number&quot;. When component 0
 is the atom-type code, it is used to number the sites with the
 same atom type. This component code must start with at least one
 digit which is not followed by a + or - sign (to distinguish it
 from the component 0 rules).
 Components 2 to 6 contain the identifier, residue, sequence,
 asymmetry identifier and alternate codes, respectively. These
 codes may be composed of any characters except an underscore.

### \_atom\_site\_occupancy

The fraction of the atom type present at this site.
 The sum of the occupancies of all the atom types at this site
 may not significantly exceed 1.0 unless it is a dummy site. The
 value must lie in the 99.97% Gaussian confidence interval
 -3u =&lt; x =&lt; 1 + 3u. The \_enumeration\_range of 0.0:1.0 is thus
 correctly interpreted as meaning (0.0 - 3u) =&lt; x =&lt; (1.0 + 3u).

### \_atom\_site\_refinement\_flags

A concatenated series of single-letter codes which indicate the
 refinement restraints or constraints applied to this site.  This
 item should not be used.  It has been replaced by
 \_atom\_site\_refinement\_flags\_posn, \*\_adp and \*\_occupancy. It is
 retained in this dictionary only to provide compatibility with
 legacy CIFs.

## CHEMICAL\_FORMULA

\_chemical\_formula\_ items specify the composition and chemical
properties of the compound. The formula data items must agree
with those that specify the density, unit-cell and Z values.

The following rules apply to the construction of the data items
\_chemical\_formula\_analytical, \*\_structural and \*\_sum. For the
data item \*\_moiety, the formula construction is broken up into
residues or moieties, i.e. groups of atoms that form a molecular
unit or molecular ion. The  rules given below apply within each
moiety but different requirements apply to the way that moieties
are connected (see \_chemical\_formula\_moiety).

(1) Only recognized element symbols may be used.

(2) Each element symbol is followed by a &#39;count&#39; number. A
   count of &#39;1&#39; may be omitted.

(3) A space or parenthesis must separate each cluster of (element
   symbol + count).

(4) Where a group of elements is enclosed in parentheses, the
   multiplier for the group must follow the closing parenthesis.
   That is, all element and group multipliers are assumed to be
   printed as subscripted numbers. (An exception to this rule
   exists for \*\_moiety formulae where pre- and post-multipliers
   are permitted for molecular units.)

(5) Unless the elements are ordered in a manner that corresponds
   to their chemical structure, as in
   \_chemical\_formula\_structural, the order of the elements within
   any group or moiety depends on whether carbon is present or
   not. If carbon is present, the order should be: C, then H,
   then the other elements in alphabetical order of their
   symbol. If carbon is not present, the elements are listed
   purely in alphabetical order of their symbol. This is the
   &#39;Hill&#39; system used by Chemical Abstracts. This ordering is
   used in \_chemical\_formula\_moiety and \_chemical\_formula\_sum.

### \_chemical\_formula\_analytical

Formula determined by standard chemical analysis including trace
 elements. See the \_chemical\_formula\_[] category description for

 intensities are greater than the initial ones.  If no
 measurable decay has occurred, the standard uncertainty should

 the cell. This quantity is useful for assessing the
 significance of \*\_min and \*\_max values, and also for
 defining suitable contour levels.

Units: electrons per cubic angstrom

### \_refine\_ls\_abs\_structure\_details

### \_refine\_ls\_abs\_structure\_Flack

The measure of absolute structure as defined by Flack (1983).

 For centrosymmetric structures, the only permitted value, if the
 data name is present, is &#39;inapplicable&#39;, represented by &#39;.&#39; .

 For noncentrosymmetric structures, the value must lie in the
 99.97% Gaussian confidence interval  -3u =&lt; x =&lt; 1 + 3u and a
 standard uncertainty (e.s.d.) u must be supplied. The
 \_enumeration\_range of 0.0:1.0 is correctly interpreted as
 meaning (0.0 - 3u) =&lt; x =&lt; (1.0 + 3u).

 Ref: Flack, H. D. (1983). Acta Cryst. A39, 876-881.

### \_refine\_ls\_abs\_structure\_Rogers

The measure of absolute structure as defined by Rogers (1981).

 The value must lie in the 99.97% Gaussian confidence interval
 -1 -3u =&lt; &eta; =&lt; 1 + 3u and a standard uncertainty (e.s.d.) u must
 be supplied. The \_enumeration\_range of -1.0:1.0 is correctly
 interpreted as meaning (-1.0 - 3u) =&lt; &eta; =&lt; (1.0 + 3u).

 Ref: Rogers, D. (1981). Acta Cryst. A37, 734-741.

### \_refine\_ls\_d\_res\_high

 of the reflections used in the refinement. This is called
 the highest resolution.

Units: angstroms

### \_refine\_ls\_d\_res\_low

 of the reflections used in the refinement. This is called
 the lowest resolution.

Units: angstroms

### \_refine\_ls\_extinction\_coef

The extinction coefficient used to calculate the correction
 factor applied to the structure-factor data. The nature of the
 extinction coefficient is given in the definitions of
 \_refine\_ls\_extinction\_expression and
 \_refine\_ls\_extinction\_method.

 For the &#39;Zachariasen&#39; method it is the r\* value; for the
 &#39;Becker-Coppens type 1 isotropic&#39; method it is the &#39;g&#39; value
 and for &#39;Becker-Coppens type 2 isotropic&#39; corrections it is
 the &#39;rho&#39; value. Note that the magnitude of these values is
 usually of the order of 10000.

 Ref:  Becker, P. J. &amp; Coppens, P. (1974). Acta Cryst. A30,
       129-147, 148-153.
       Zachariasen, W. H. (1967). Acta Cryst. 23, 558-564.
       Larson, A. C. (1967). Acta Cryst. 23, 664-665.

### \_refine\_ls\_extinction\_expression

A description of or reference to the extinction-correction
 equation used to apply the data item \_refine\_ls\_extinction\_coef.
 This information must be sufficient to reproduce the
 extinction-correction factors applied to the structure factors.

### \_refine\_ls\_extinction\_method

A description of the extinction-correction method applied.
 This description should
 include information about the correction method, either
 &#39;Becker-Coppens&#39; or &#39;Zachariasen&#39;. The latter is sometimes
 referred to as the &#39;Larson&#39; method even though it employs
 Zachariasen&#39;s formula.

 The Becker-Coppens procedure is referred to as &#39;type 1&#39; when
 correcting secondary extinction dominated by the mosaic spread;
 as &#39;type 2&#39; when secondary extinction is dominated by particle
 size and includes a primary extinction component; and as &#39;mixed&#39;
 when there is a mixture of types 1 and 2.

 For the Becker-Coppens method, it is also necessary to set the
 mosaic distribution as either &#39;Gaussian&#39; or &#39;Lorentzian&#39; and
 the nature of the extinction as &#39;isotropic&#39; or &#39;anisotropic&#39;.
 Note that if either the &#39;mixed&#39; or &#39;anisotropic&#39; corrections
 are applied, the multiple coefficients cannot be contained in
 \*\_extinction\_coef and must be listed in \_refine\_special\_details.

 where, working from the \_diffrn\_refln\_ list,

 N(crystal class) is the number of reflections obtained on
    averaging under the symmetry of the crystal class
 N(Laue symmetry) is the number of reflections obtained on
    averaging under the Laue symmetry.

 Examples:
   (a) For centrosymmetric structures, \_reflns\_Friedel\_coverage
       is necessarily equal to 0.0 as the crystal class
       is identical to the Laue symmetry.
   (b) For whole-sphere data for a crystal in the space
       group P1, \_reflns\_Friedel\_coverage is equal to 1.0,
       as no reflection h k l is equivalent to -h -k -l
       in the crystal class and all Friedel pairs
       {h k l; -h -k -l} have been measured.
   (c) For whole-sphere data in space group Pmm2,
       \_reflns\_Friedel\_coverage will be &lt; 1.0 because
       although reflections h k l and
       -h -k -l are not equivalent when h k l indices are
       nonzero, they are when l=0.
   (d) For a crystal in the space group Pmm2, measurements of the
       two inequivalent octants h &gt;= 0, k &gt;=0, l lead to the
       same value as in (c), whereas measurements of the
       two equivalent octants h &gt;= 0, k, l &gt;= 0 will lead to
       a value of zero for \_reflns\_Friedel\_coverage.

## SPACE\_GROUP

Contains all the data items that refer to the space group as a
 whole, such as its name or crystal system. They may be looped,
 for example, in a list of space groups and their properties.

 Only a subset of the SPACE\_GROUP category items appear in the
 core dictionary.  The remainder are found in the symmetry CIF
 dictionary.

 Space-group types are identified by their number as given in
 International Tables for Crystallography Vol. A. Specific
 settings of the space groups can be identified either by their
 Hall symbol or by specifying their symmetry operations.

 The commonly used Hermann-Mauguin symbol determines the
 space-group type uniquely but several different Hermann-Mauguin
 symbols may refer to the same space-group type. A
 Hermann-Mauguin symbol contains information on the choice of
 the basis, but not on the choice of origin.  Different formats
 for the Hermann-Mauguin symbol are found in the symmetry CIF
 dictionary.

### \_space\_group\_crystal\_system

The name of the system of geometric crystal classes of space
 groups (crystal system) to which the space group belongs.
 Note that rhombohedral space groups belong to the
 trigonal system.

Values:

* triclinic
* monoclinic
* orthorhombic
* tetragonal
* trigonal
* hexagonal
* cubic

### \_space\_group\_id

This is an identifier needed if \_space\_group\_ items are looped.

### \_space\_group\_IT\_number

The number as assigned in International Tables for
 Crystallography Vol. A, specifying the proper affine class (i.e.
 the orientation-preserving affine class) of space groups
 (crystallographic space-group type) to which the space group
 belongs.  This number defines the space-group type but not
 the coordinate system in which it is expressed.

### \_space\_group\_name\_H-M\_alt

\_space\_group\_name\_H-M\_alt allows any Hermann-Mauguin symbol
 to be given. The way in which this item is used is determined
 by the user and in general is not intended to be interpreted by
 computer. It may, for example, be used to give one of the
 extended Hermann-Mauguin symbols given in Table 4.3.2.1 of
 International Tables for Crystallography Vol. A (2002) or
 a Hermann-Mauguin symbol for a conventional or unconventional
 setting.

 Each component of the space-group name is separated by a
 space or an underscore. The use of a space is strongly
 recommended.  The underscore is only retained because it
 was used in older files. It should not be
 used in new CIFs. Subscripts should appear without special
 symbols. Bars should be given as negative signs before the
 numbers to which they apply.

 The commonly used Hermann-Mauguin symbol determines the space-
 group type uniquely but a given space-group type may be
 described by more than one Hermann-Mauguin symbol. The space-
 group type is best described using \_space\_group\_IT\_number.

 The Hermann-Mauguin symbol may contain information on the
 choice of basis, but not on the choice of origin. To
 define the setting uniquely, use \_space\_group\_name\_Hall or
 list the symmetry operations.

### \_space\_group\_name\_Hall

Space-group symbol defined by Hall.

 Each component of the space-group name is separated by a
 space or an underscore.  The use of a space is strongly
 recommended.  The underscore is only retained because it
 was used in older files.  It should not be
 used in new CIFs.

 \_space\_group\_name\_Hall uniquely defines the space group and
 its reference to a particular coordinate system.

 Ref: Hall, S. R. (1981). Acta Cryst. A37, 517-525; erratum
      (1981), A37, 921.
      [See also International Tables for Crystallography,
      Vol. B (2001), Chapter 1.4, Appendix 1.4.2]

## SPACE\_GROUP\_SYMOP

Contains information about the symmetry operations of the
 space group.

### \_space\_group\_symop\_id

An arbitrary identifier that uniquely labels each symmetry
 operation in the list.

 In order for the defaults to work correctly, the identity
 operation should have \_space\_group\_symop\_id or
 \_symmetry\_equiv\_pos\_site\_id set to 1, and
 \_space\_group\_symop\_operation\_xyz or
 \_symmetry\_equiv\_pos\_as\_xyz set to x,y,z; 
 i.e. the operation labelled 1 should be the identity
 operation.

### \_space\_group\_symop\_operation\_xyz

A parsable string giving one of the symmetry operations of the
 space group in algebraic form.  If W is a matrix representation
 of the rotational part of the symmetry operation defined by the
 positions and signs of x, y and z, and w is a column of
 translations defined by fractions, an equivalent position
 X&#39; is generated from a given position X by the equation

           X&#39; = WX + w

 (Note: X is used to represent bold\_italics\_x in International
 Tables for Crystallography Vol. A, Part 5)

 When a list of symmetry operations is given, it must contain
 a complete set of coordinate representatives which generates
 all the operations of the space group by the addition of
 all primitive translations of the space group. Such
 representatives are to be found as the coordinates of
 the general-equivalent position in International Tables for
 Crystallography Vol. A (2002), to which it is necessary to 
 add any centring translations shown above the 
 general-equivalent position.

 That is to say, it is necessary to list explicitly all the
 symmetry operations required to generate all the atoms in
 the unit cell defined by the setting used.

In order for the defaults to work correctly, the identity
operation should have \_space\_group\_symop\_id or
\_symmetry\_equiv\_pos\_site\_id set to 1, and
\_space\_group\_symop\_operation\_xyz or
\_symmetry\_equiv\_pos\_as\_xyz set to x,y,z; 
i.e. the operation labelled 1 should be the identity
operation.

### \_space\_group\_symop\_sg\_id

This must match a particular value of \_space\_group\_id, allowing
 the symmetry operation to be identified with a particular space
 group.

## SYMMETRY

Data items in the SYMMETRY category record details about the
 space-group symmetry.

### \_symmetry\_cell\_setting

The cell settings for this space-group symmetry.

Values:

* triclinic
* monoclinic
* orthorhombic
* tetragonal
* rhombohedral
* trigonal
* hexagonal
* cubic

### \_symmetry\_Int\_Tables\_number

Space-group number from International Tables for Crystallography
 Vol. A (2002).

### \_symmetry\_space\_group\_name\_H-M

Hermann-Mauguin space-group symbol. Note that the Hermann-Mauguin
 symbol does not necessarily contain complete information
 about the symmetry and the space-group origin. If used, always
 supply the FULL symbol from International Tables for
 Crystallography Vol. A (2002) and indicate the origin and
 the setting if it is not implicit. If there is any doubt
 that the equivalent positions can be uniquely deduced from
 this symbol, specify the \_symmetry\_equiv\_pos\_as\_xyz
 or \*\_Hall data items as well. Leave spaces between
 symbols referring to different axes.


### \_symmetry\_space\_group\_name\_Hall

Space-group symbol as described by Hall. This symbol gives the
 space-group setting explicitly. Leave spaces between the separate
 components of the symbol.

 Ref: Hall, S. R. (1981). Acta Cryst. A37, 517-525; erratum
 (1981), A37, 921.

## SYMMETRY\_EQUIV

Data items in the SYMMETRY\_EQUIV category list the
 symmetry-equivalent positions for the space group.

### \_symmetry\_equiv\_pos\_as\_xyz

Symmetry-equivalent position in the &#39;xyz&#39; representation. Except
 for the space group P1, these data will be repeated in a loop.
 The format of the data item is as per International Tables for
 Crystallography Vol. A. (2002). All equivalent positions should
 be entered, including those for lattice centring and a centre of
 symmetry, if present.

 In order for the defaults to work correctly, the identity
 operation should have \_space\_group\_symop\_id or
 \_symmetry\_equiv\_pos\_site\_id set to 1, and
 \_space\_group\_symop\_operation\_xyz or
 \_symmetry\_equiv\_pos\_as\_xyz set to x,y,z; 
 i.e. the operation labelled 1 should be the identity
 operation.

### \_symmetry\_equiv\_pos\_site\_id

A code identifying each entry in the \_symmetry\_equiv\_pos\_as\_xyz
 list. It is normally the sequence number of the entry in that
 list, and should be identified with the code &#39;n&#39; in
 \_geom\_\*\_symmetry\_ codes of the form &#39;n\_klm&#39;.

 In order for the defaults to work correctly, the identity
 operation should have \_space\_group\_symop\_id or
 \_symmetry\_equiv\_pos\_site\_id set to 1, and
 \_space\_group\_symop\_operation\_xyz or
 \_symmetry\_equiv\_pos\_as\_xyz set to x,y,z; 
 i.e. the operation labelled 1 should be the identity
 operation.

## VALENCE\_PARAM

 parameters used for calculating bond valences from bond
 lengths.  In addition to the parameters, a pointer
 is given to the reference (in VALENCE\_REF) from which
 the bond-valence parameters were taken.
