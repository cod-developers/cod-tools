<abstract>(4-Biphenylyl)phenyldibenzofulvene is weakly luminescent in the amorphous phase but becomes highly emissive upon crystallization; this unusual crystallization-induced emission enhancement effect allows its emission to be repeatedly switched between dark and bright states by fuming-heating and heating-cooling processes.</abstract>
