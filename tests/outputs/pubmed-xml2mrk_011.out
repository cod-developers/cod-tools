<abstract>A series of complexes based on the combination of cyclometallated palladium or platinum moieties with functionalized dipyrrin ligands bearing mesityl- or benzonitrile groups have been prepared and characterized both in the solid state and in solution; these compounds exhibit a characteristic dipyrrin-centered luminescence with an emission intensity modulated by the degree of rotational freedom of the aromatic group attached to the dipyrrin chelate.</abstract>
