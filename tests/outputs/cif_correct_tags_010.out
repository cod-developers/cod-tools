scripts/cif_correct_tags: tests/cases/cif_correct_tags_010.inp data_looped: NOTE, data item '_publ_contact_autor' was left intact -- it should have been renamed to '_publ_contact_author' as specified in the replacement file 'tests/inputs/cif_correct_tags/lst/replacement_tags.lst', but the replacement data item was already present in the data block. Value comparison was skipped since the '_publ_contact_autor' data item was found within a loop structure.
