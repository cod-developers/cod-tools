<abstract>Single crystals of Li(6)CuB(4)O(10) have been synthesized, and its crystal structure has been determined. Li(6)CuB(4)O(10) crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric triclinic space group P1 (No. 1). The structure consists of isolated [CuB(4)O(10)](6)(-) polyanions that are bridged by six LiO(4) tetrahedra. Li(6)CuB(4)O(10) is a congruently melting compound. It produces SHG intensity similar to that produced by KH(2)PO(4) and is phase-matchable.</abstract>
