Tests the way looped subcategories that can use the category key of their
looped parent category are handled. Dictionaries used in this test case
define the category keys using exclusively the '_category_key.name'
attribute since the '_category.key_id' attribute was removed from
the DDLm reference dictionary in version 4.0.0.
