Tests behaviour with the input file that contains disorder and has some atoms
with identical names. --uniquify-atoms option is used to force the
uniquification of atom names. Warnings about non-unique atom names and the
fact that they have been renamed (maybe change to notes?) are raised.

For script behaviour with --uniquify-atoms option disabled see test
cif_molecule_009.
