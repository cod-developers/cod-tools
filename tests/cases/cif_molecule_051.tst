Tests behaviour when dealing with files that contain atoms that are very close.
Normally, these atoms should be considered a bump, but in this case they are not
due to them existing in different disorder sites.
Warnings about non-unique atom names and the fact that they have been renamed
(maybe change to notes?) are raised.
