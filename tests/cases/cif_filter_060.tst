Test the behaviour of the script when the '--estimate-spacegroup' and
'--keep-unrecognised-spacegroups' options are in effect and the input
CIF file contains a space group operation list that does not correspond
to a known space group. The given space group name and number should be
left unchanged.

This test case has been mostly superseded by test cases 'cif_filer_201',
'cif_filer_202' and 'cif_filer_203' except for the different spelling of
the options used.
