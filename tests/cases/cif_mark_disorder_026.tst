Input CIF file (synthetic) has rather unusual unmarked disorder: coordinates
of atom 'Ca' from the original file are modified by applying '-x,-y,-z'
symmetry operator. Thus by looking just at the asymmetric unit cell it is
impossible to say that there is an unmarked disorder, symmetry has to be
reconstructed to notice that these sites overlap.
