This document describes the nomenclature used in the COD::AtomProperties
module. Most of it corresponds to the internationally  recognised sources
like IUPAC, but some deviations have to be noted:

--  Lanthanides. All elements with atomic numbers [57-71] are considered 
    lanthanides as defined by IUPAC. All lanthanides are assigned a group 
    number of 19.
--  Actinides. All elements with atomic numbers [89-103] are considered 
    actinides as defined by IUPAC. All actinides are assigned a group number
    of 20.
--  Atomic weight/mass.These two terms are oftenly mistaken for each other.
    -- Atomic weight. In this document it is interpreted as standard atomic
       weight published by IUPAC in regular intervals.
    -- Atomic mass. In this document it is interpret as the exact mass 
       of the most common isotope of an element.

Some fields of the atom entries are described in detail:

--  covalent_radii. A hash of covalent radii values of the element in regard 
    to the number of electrons used in bonding. Accepted values are 
    "single", "double" and "triple" bonds. Measured in angstroms.
--  covalent_radius. The longest of the radii given in "covalent_radii" field.
    Measured in angstroms.
--  spin_state_radii. A hash of covalent radii values of the element in regard 
    to the spin state. Accepted values are "l.s." for low spin and "h.s" for 
    high spin. Measured in angstroms.
