DUE TO: EMC26
1. Autodeposition URL.
2. Validation site.

== Depositors interface requirements
=== Sanity checks
Check if provided e-mail is valid (RFC??? e-mail), and it's domain
does have MX DNS record (a MUST).

Publication author name, who is suspected depositor, SHOULD match
bibtex/etc. rules.

Interaction with deposition script (cif-deposit.pl so far) via cURL
library. @see SSL, timeout (maybe servers list to iterate over), etc.

== Data deposition requirements
=== Published data deposition
Requirements for publication:
    a) MUST have bibliography;
    b) we MAY rely on quality checks made by the publishing journal.

=== Data prior to publication deposition
Requirements for publication:
    a) There MUST be an option "on-hold", which is valid until
       publication, but for period no longer than 1 year.
       After that period, if structure was not published,
       author is contacted (using e-mail provided, see [b]
       particle) to ask, what to do next;
    b) Quality checks must be more stringent; at least as good
       as in IUCr (i.e. PLATON). Checks are made using
       `cif_cod_check` as well;
    c) It SHOULD NOT contain bibliography entries;
    d) It MUST contain author's names, affiliations and e-mails.
       Later is being kept private and communication with author
       is made possible using web-form, which uses CAPTCHA.

=== Personal communication to COD deposition
Requirements for publication:
    a) Quality checks must be more stringent; at least as good
       as in IUCr (i.e. PLATON). Checks are made using
       `cif_cod_check` as well. Checks MAY be more stringent
       than in data prior to publication deposition;
    b) Bibliography MUST define the following:
       o) _journal_name_full    'Personal communications to COD'
       o) _journal_year         2010 # year part of deposition timestamp
       o) _journal_issue        06   # month part of deposition timestamp
       o) _cod_publication_date 2010-06-11   # year-month-day of deposition
       o) _publ_author_name     One or more author names
    c) It MUST contain name, affiliation and e-mail of at least
       one (here - depositing) author.
       E-mail is being kept private and communication with author
       is made possible using web-form, which uses CAPTCHA.

== Deposition script
https://cod.ibt.lt/cgi-bin/deposit.pl
POST'ed file using name 'cif' (Content-Disposition: form-data; \
name="cif"; filename="user-supplied-name.cif").
POST options are as following:
     o) user         user name identifying depositor (might be script)
        on COD servers;
     o) pass         password used to authenticate user on COD servers;
     o) check[]      Tests to be carried on against structure provided
        if user has privileges to turn them on/off;
     o) dont-check[] Tests NOT to be carried on against structure
        provided if user has privileges to turn them on/off.
