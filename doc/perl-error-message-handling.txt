=====================================================================
1. INTRO

The document describes the most common ways Perl error messages should be
handled in the COD (Crystallography Open Database) software.

Not all error messages are equally severe and it is sometimes desirable for
the script to differentiate its behaviour in regards to that -- terminate on
one type of error messages and continue on other. Currently, 3 severity levels
are used in the COD software -- NOTE, WARNING and ERROR -- which are described
in [paper citation/add descriptions to the document].

For the error message format used through-out this document, please refer to 
the 'error-messages-conventions.txt' document.

2. COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

The default behaviour of most COD scripts is to terminate on ERROR level
warnings and continue on all other. In case the script requires different
customization on different runs, the following options should be implemented:

#* -c, --always-continue
#*                     Continue processing and return successful return status
#*                     despite error messages of any severity being raised.
#* -c-, --always-die
#*                     Stop and return error status if error messages of any
#*                     severity are raised.
#*
#* --continue-on-errors
#*                     Do not terminate script if errors are raised.
#* --die-on-errors
#*                     Terminate script immediately if errors are raised (default).
#*
#* --continue-on-warnings
#*                     Do not terminate script if warnings are raised (default).
#* --die-on-warnings
#*                     Terminate script immediately if warnings are raised.
#*
#* --continue-on-notes
#*                     Do not terminate script if notes are raised (default).
#* --die-on-notes
#*                     Terminate script immediately if notes are raised.

Example of the implementation of these options can be found in 'cod-tools'
package scripts like 'cif2cod', 'cif_molecule', etc.

3. RAISING ERROR MESSAGES

Error messages are raised via the in-built Perl subroutines warn() and die().
The die() subroutine is only used to raise ERROR level messages. All messages
should be prefixed by their severity level followed by a comma and a white
space (e.g 'NOTE, '). If no severity level is provided, messages raised via
die() should be treated as ERRORs and messages raised via warn() should be
treated as WARNINGs.Messages should terminate with a new line symbol ('\n')
to prevent the concatenation of additional information to the end of the
message. Messages can be raised in any part of the program (module, subroutine),
but should be handled in the top level of the script.

4. HANDLING ERROR MESSAGES

Messages raised by warn() are captured and formatted by locally redefining
the Perl __WARN__ signal handling subroutine in the top level of the script.
For example:

{
    local $SIG{__WARN__} = {
        my $message = my_formatting_subroutine(@_);
        $die_on_notes ? die $message : warn $message;
    };

    warn "NOTE, this warn signal will be handled locally -- "
       . "script will even die if required\n";
}

Handling of messages raised by die() requires a different approach that
is most similar to try-catch mechanisms in other languages (JAVA, for example).
Since there is no way to prevent the script from terminating by simply
locally overwriting the $SIG{__DIE__} signal handler, the signal itself must
be caught with the help of eval{} block statement and stored in the $@ variable.
It can then be passed to an error handling subroutine. For example:

for (my $i = 0; $i++; $i < 3) {
    eval {
        die "ERROR, died at iteration $i -- died at iteration 1 is also true\n";
    };
    if ($@) {
        my $message = my_formatting_subroutine($@);
        $die_on_errors ? die $message : warn $message;
    }
};

One of the main differences between the warn() and die() subroutines is that
the die signal exits all inner blocks along the way until the signal is caught.
As a result, the only place where the script can continue after the die()
subroutine call is outside the eval{} block. This is not true for the warn()
subroutine -- the script can execute statements that follow right after the
warn() subroutine call.

4. PATTERNS

Error message handling was recognized as a cross-cutting concern and
COD::ErrorHandler Perl module was developed to aid this task. The module
contains subroutines that can be used as die and warn signal handlers, as
well as a subroutine to handle errors returned by the COD::CIF::Parser.
Descriptions of common situations that require error message handling and
examples of how to use the appropriate COD::ErrorHandler subroutines are
provided below.

4A. CIF PARSER SCOPE

COD::CIF::Parser module provides an interface to an error-fixing CIF parser
via the parse_cif subroutine. The subroutine returns three parameters --
the parsed structure, number of ERRORs the parser has encountered and the
list of error messages that are formatted following the error message grammar
(using the COD::UserMessage module). The last two parameters can be used for
error handling.

By default, parse_cif subroutine also outputs the formatted error messages
directly to STDERR, so these messages cannot be captured via the previously
described warn/die capturing method. However, if the 'no_print' option is
passed to the subroutine the printing of error messages is suppressed. Due to
this the following approach has been developed:
1) Print all error messages returned by the parser to STDERR;
2) Count the number of messages for each error level;
3) Print an additional error message for each error level that had at least
   one occurrence. The error message should state the error level and the number
   of messages. If the script is required to terminate on that error level,
   the message should be printed to STDERR as an ERROR with an additional
   explanation concatenated to the end of the message; the script should then
   terminate. Otherwise, the message should be printed to STDERR as a NOTE.
   It is preferred to print these summarizing message in the order of increasing
   severity. For example:

   script: parsed_file: NOTE, 3 NOTE(s) encountered while parsing the file.
   script: parsed_file: NOTE, 2 WARNING(s) encountered while parsing the file.
   script: parsed_file: ERROR, 1 ERROR(s) encountered while parsing the file -- die on ERROR(s) requested.

The described approach has been implemented in the
COD::ErrorHandler::process_parser_messages subroutine. The pattern illustrating
how the subroutine should be used is provided below.

% START Perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use COD::ErrorHandler qw(process_parser_messages);

# Hash containing terminate/continue flags for each error level
my $die_on_error_level = {
    ERROR   => 1,
    WARNING => 0,
    NOTE    => 0
};

@ARGV = ("-") unless @ARGV;

for my $filename (@ARGV) {

    # Suppressing the printing of error messages with 'no_print' option
    my $options = { 'parser' => 'c', 'no_print' => 1 };
    my ( $data, $err_count, $messages ) = parse_cif( $filename, $options );
    process_parser_messages( $messages, $die_on_error_level );

    # Processing of datablocks goes here
}
% END Perl

4B. SINGLE DATABLOCK SCOPE

One of the most common CIF file processing patterns found in COD scripts is to
parse the file and then iterate over the returned datablocks one by one. Since
the name of the currently processed file and datablock are know in the top
level of the script, they can be passed to the warn/die signal handling
functions (as described in section 4 of this document). COD::ErrorHandler
module provides COD::ErrorHandler::process_errors and
COD::ErrorHandler::process_warning subroutines to handle error messages
while processing datablocks. The pattern illustrating how these subroutines
should be used is provided below.

% START Perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use COD::ErrorHandler qw(process_warnings process_errors);

# Variable holding the values of terminate/continue flags for each error level
my $die_on_errors   = 1;
my $die_on_warnings = 0;
my $die_on_notes    = 0;

@ARGV = ("-") unless @ARGV;

for my $filename (@ARGV) {
    # For the sake of brevity, errors messages raised by the parser are not
    # handled in this example. However, the following statements can be 
    # easily replaced by the pattern presented in 4A
    my $options = { 'parser' => 'c' };
    my ( $data, $err_count, $messages ) = parse_cif( $filename, $options );

    for my $datablock (@$data) {
        # Adding a prefix to the dataname. NOTE: the current version of the
        # CIF parser might return an undefined dataname
        my $dataname = 'data_' . $datablock->{name} if defined $datablock->{name};

        # Locally redefining the Perl __WARN__ signal handling subroutine
        local $SIG{__WARN__} =
                   sub {process_warnings( $filename, $dataname, @_,
                                          {
                                            WARNING => $die_on_warnings,
                                            NOTE    => $die_on_notes
                                          }
                                        ) };

        # A pattern resembling the try/catch pattern in other languages
        eval {
            # Datablock processing logic goes here
        };
        if ($@) {
            process_errors( $filename, $dataname, $@, $die_on_errors );
        }
    }
}
% END Perl

It should be noted, that unlike COD::ErrorHandler::process_parser_messages
(see section 4A) subroutine that prints all messages and only then terminates
the script if required, COD::ErrorHandler::process_warnings and
COD::ErrorHandler::process_errors subroutines terminate the script on the
first occurrence of the error message level that requires script termination.
Upon termination these subroutines also output an additional ERROR message most
similar to that issued by COD::ErrorHandler::process_parser_messages upon
termination, but with the message count set to '1'. Since the error level
of the messages themselves is not changed upon termination (NOTEs don't become
WARNINGs and WARNINGs do not become ERRORs), the aforementioned ERROR message
provides an invariant that all terminated scripts raised at least 1 ERROR
level message (for discussion about modifying this invariant by adding a
new FATAL error level, please see section 5).

4C. NON-CIF FILE SCOPE

Alongside CIF files some scripts also deal with non-CIF files (CIF headers,
config files, etc.). The approach to handling error messages that arise
while processing these files is very similar to the one used when dealing with
CIF file datablocks (see 4B). However, some minor differences do arise, like,
for example, the lack of the datablock name in the non-CIF files or the need
to handle open/close operations of the non-CIF files directly (CIF parser
handles these operations automatically when parsing a CIF file). These
differences are minuscule enough to allow the reuse of the same subroutines.
The pattern illustrating how these subroutines should be used is provided below.

% BEGIN Perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use COD::ErrorHandler qw(process_warnings process_errors);

# Variable holding the values of terminate/continue flags for each error level
my $die_on_errors   = 1;
my $die_on_warnings = 0;
my $die_on_notes    = 0;

my $die_on_error_level = {
    ERROR   => $die_on_errors,
    WARNING => $die_on_warnings,
    NOTE    => $die_on_notes
};

my $file = 'non-cif-file.txt';

eval {
    local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { process_warnings(
                                       $file, undef,
                                       @_, $die_on_error_level ) };

    if( defined $file ) {
        open( FILE, $file ) or die "ERROR, "
          . "could not open file for input -- "
          . lcfirst($!) . "\n";

        foreach( <FILE> ) {
            chomp;
            if( /^#/ or /^\s*$/ ) {
                warn "WARNING, skipped a comment line:\n$_";
            } else {
                print $_\n;
            }
        }

        close( LIST ) or die "ERROR, "
           . "error while closing file after reading -- "
           . lcfirst($!) . "\n";
    }
};
if ($@) {
    process_errors( $replacement_file, undef, $@, $die_on_errors );
};

% END Perl
