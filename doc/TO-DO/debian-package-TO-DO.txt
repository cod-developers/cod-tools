-- Run 'lintian' automatically after building packages.

-- Generate REAL changelog files.

++ Employ 'dh_python2' to collect Python dependencies and prepare other
   Python-related stuff. DONE -- A.M.

-- Find a way to compile Bison.so for all (most?) versions of Perl.
   'perlbrew' can be used here, and generated objects can be placed under
   /usr/lib/perl/${PERL_VERSION}, with PERL_VERSION = 5.18.2, ...

   Addition of ${perl:Depends} to the dependencies adds correct dependency
   on Perl API (i.e. perlapi-5.18.2). All we need now is to prepare
   packages depending on various Perl API versions.

++ Fix COPYRIGHT file according to 'lintian' suggestions.

++ Think whether to include cif_printout_Python in 'cod-tools' package, as
   this single script adds a dependency on 'python' and related packages.
   REMOVED -- A.M.

-- Restore SPOT in maintaining dependencies' list, since now dependencies
   are stored both under dependencies/*/{build,run}.sh and debian/control.
