-- Are empty loops (i.e. loops with no elements) really errors
   according to the syntax?

++ Fold long lines, especially in lists, in the cif_filter script.

-- Emit warnings from the CIFParser; make option to switch them off.

-- Optionally, accept CIF files with the missing first data_ header. 
   Such files are formally incorrect, but they are somtimes encountered 
   in journal aucilliary data, and can be easily fixed. A warning in 
   such case is appropriate, and there should be a '--strict' option to
   reject such files as errors.

-- Check for CIF files with lines longer than 80 characters, emit
   warning or error if the --strict option was specified.

++ !! detect and report duplicate tags in the CIFParser module. 
   Duplicates in loops are especially nasty!

++ Think how to deal with non-ASCII characters in CIF files. DONE:
   Changing non-ASCII characters to XML-like entity codes.
