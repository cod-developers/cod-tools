++ Fix the COD search bug: not the search engine finds "N", "Na" and
   "Mn" when search for "N". It should finr only N; besides, it should
   give a possibility to search for N4, returning structure files with
   exactely four nitrogens in the _chemical_formula_sum.

++ Add backreferences to Acta Cryst paper using coeditor code.

++ Modify COD search scripts to deal with "formulas" like
   '- C? Cl? H? Ir? S? -'.

++ Modify COD web site so that it correctly uses UTF8 text from the
   COD MySQL database.

++ Display the number of structures and records in the COD front page
   dynamically.
   With correct plural version of word 'entries'.

++ Display exact number of hits even if only 300 hits are returned,
   with an appropriate message.

++ Add possibility to search by the COD number range, and to retrieve
   a specific COD number.

-- Add possibility to change end-of-line encoding for downloadable COD
   files on the fly (i.e. transform to MAC/DOS eol encoding upon
   request, and if user's browser indicates that it comes from the
   specified systems).

+- Add possibility to download all found files in one .zip file; add
   query text and query date into the archive. Make it possible to
   choose end-of-line encodings.

++ Rename 'cod_old' database into 'cod'.

++ Check PCOD database, fix it if necessary (create the 'pcod'
   database).

++ Eliminate entries with duplicate 'file' field from the COD data
   table.

++ ALTER TABLE data MODIFY COLUMN file MEDIUMINT(7) UNSIGNED UNIQUE;
   load splitted CIF files into COD svn repository, and load their
   data into MySQL database.

++ Make 'entry' unique (primary).

++ Add headers with SVN keywords, COD URL, and copying policy into
   each COD CIF file that does not have it. Add svn:keywords property
   to all existing COD CIF files.

-- Add svn:keywords auto-property into our .svn/conf files.

-- Add extra fields to the COD 'data' table:
   JOURNAL (from the _journal_name_full),
   JOURNAL_ID at some stage, when information regarding journal
   abbreviations is fetched.
   VOLUME (journal volume),
   ISSUE (journal issue),
   YEAR (publication year),
   FIRST_PAGE, LAST_PAGE
   TITLE (from _publ_section_title)
   CHEM_NAME_SYSTEMATIC
   CHEM_NAME_TRIVIAL
   ACTA_CRYST_COEDITOR_CODE (ACCE_CODE)
   AUTHORS (would point to a separate
   table 'authors' containing autor lists for each entry)
   #
   For unpublished but COD-deposited structures I suggest listing
   'Crystallography Open Database (personal communication)' in the
   _journal_name_full to indicate their status, and to list authors in
   the _publ_author_name/_publ_author_address tags. The year would be
   COD deposition year.

-- Add table 'authors'.

+- Revise error messages in the CIFParser module ('bogus data'), clear
   al "decorations" from error messages ('!' or '.' at the end,
   capital letter at the beginning). Change "pos." -> "character",
   "position", "column".

++ Add option into 'cif_filter' to print CIFs with SVN headers. Or
   maybe this should be a 'cif_split_primitive' option?
   (cif_split_primitive already takes the very first header of the
   file and prints it out into all splitted files).

+- Add option/functionality into 'cif_filter' to exclude "empty" tags
   (i.e. tags that have values '?' or '.'). (So far, all values except
   the empty text fields are eliminated).

-- In the 'cif_filter' script, exclude _publ_author_address from the
   output CIF; add consistent exclusion of tags from loops, either by
   checking if the tags exists in a loop printout procedure, or by
   eliminating tags from loop description arrays in the CIF internal
   representation.

++ Write cif2cod in Perl, using the CIFParser, so that it gets all CIF
   fields correctly.

++ Prepare automatic deposition procedure that uses a command line
   script ('cod_deposit'), with all checks (syntactic, semantic,
   duplicate, etc).

++ Prepare automatic deposition procedure that uses a Web-based
   interface, with all checks (syntactic, semantic, duplicate, etc).

-- Update PCOD website, so that it won't contain explicitly COD specific 
   elements.

-- Replace some COD entries that were corrected.

++ Check all COD CIF files for syntactic correctness, fix syntax
   errors, commit changes.

-- Check all COD CIF files for semantic error (e.g. missing
   bibliography, missing chemical information, missing
   crystallographic information, inconsistent CIF "entity"
   identificators in loops, incompatibilities with dictionaries).

-- Check file names within ZIP archives.

++ Make Subversion log messages visible in information cards for each
   structure in COD; make older versions of each CIF file downloadable
   from the information card page.

-- Add depositor comments (from _cod_depositor_comments tag) and
   validation messages (probably from cod.validation database table) to
   the information card page.

-- Add links to crude CIF files in information card pages.

-- Make Fobs archives downloadable.

-- Improve the search -- harness BioDB framework.

-- Check CIF-Fobs pairs with checkCIF, PLATON or similar programs in
   validation and deposition stages.

-- Implement classification of structures in the COD entries
   (inorganics, minerals, organics etc.)

-- Improve the web site design :)

-- Add a short disclaimer to the personal communication depositor page 
   that would inform people on the preferable way to cite COD in their 
   publications.

-- Move text pages (tips.html, donators/*.html, petition/*.html etc) to
   COD Wiki.
