-- Create a CIF object and an object-oriented interface to CIFParser,
   returning the CIF Perl object;

-- Make cif_filter report symops that do not lead to determination of
   a space group, as a warning, even if --keep-unrecognised-spacegroups
   option is in action.

-- Refactor cif_mark_disorder by moving its core functionality to a seperate
   module. The same strategy can probably be applied to several other scripts
   as well.

-- Add --exclude-dummies option to cif_cell_contents.

-- Rewrite Symop::{Algebra,Parse} in C with SWIG interface to fasten
   cif_molecule, cif_p1 and the like.
