Spglib
======

Spglib is a library for finding and handling crystal symmetries
written in C.

Spglib for python is found at :ref:`python_spglib`.

Version history is summarized in `ChangeLog
<https://github.com/atztogo/spglib/blob/master/ChangeLog>`_.

News
-----

* SpglibDataset is slightly modified at version 1.9.4. This may hit
  some users.

* Python module pyspglib is renamed to spglib in version 1.9.0.

  In versions 1.8.x or before, the python wrapper (pyspglib) was
  considered as a special extention of spglib and separately maintained,
  but in version 1.9.x and later, it starts to be a part of spglib as a
  usual extension, and this python wrapper will be maintained to work
  following every update of c-spglib. The package name is changed from
  pyspglib to spglib. Following this change, the way to import python
  spglib module is changed and it is written in :ref:`python_spglib`.
