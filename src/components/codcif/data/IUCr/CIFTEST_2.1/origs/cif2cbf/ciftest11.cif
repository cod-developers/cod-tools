# Purpose: line endings - should parse OK

# The physical structure of this file needs to be considered carefully.
# It was generated as a text file on a Unix machine, and then a
# control-M (ASCII decimal 13, carriage return) was appended to the end
# of each line of text. Because the Unix newline character is control-J
# (ASCII decimal 10, newline), each line is terminated by a
# control-M/control-J pairing, and - by chance - this digraph 
# corresponds to a DOS new-line indicator. A file constructed entirely
# in this way and mounted e.g. on an NFS filesystem would be valid
# (but not identical) on both Windows and Unix platforms.
