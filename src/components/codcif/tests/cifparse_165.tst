Tests the way standard uncertainty (SU) values of numbers with exponents are
handled. This tests increases code coverage, i.e., check that certain code
fragments are executed at least once, however, it does not allow to check if
the SU values were parsed correctly since currently there is no way to output
the internal data structure of the parser.
