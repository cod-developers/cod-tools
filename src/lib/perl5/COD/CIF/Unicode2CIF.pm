# Encodes combining characters in a text string by replacing
# Unicode combining characters with CIF 1.1 special codes [1,2].
# Encoding is carried out using the following rules:
#
# 1) If the combining character sequence has a single combining character
#    and the combining character can be expressed as a CIF 1.1 code,
#    then the sequence is encoded by moving the combining character
#    before the base character and replacing it with the CIF 1.1 code.
#    For example, small letter N with a tilde ("Ã±") is encoded as "\~n".
# 2) If the combining character sequence has a single combining character
#    and the combining character cannot be expressed as a CIF 1.1 code,
#    then the sequence is encoded by converting the combining character
#    to a hexadecimal numeric character reference. For example,
#    small letter S with a ring above ("sÌŠ") is encoded as "s&#x030A;".
# 3) If the combining character sequence has more than one combining
#    character, then the sequence is encoded by converting all of the
#    combining symbols to hexadecimal numeric character references.
#    For example, small letter U with diaeresis and macron ("Ç–") is
#    encoded as "u&#x0308;&#x0304;".
