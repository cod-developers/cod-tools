 Refinement of F^2^ against ALL reflections.  The weighted R-factor wR and 
 goodness of fit S are based on F^2^, conventional R-factors R are based 
 on F, with F set to zero for negative F^2^. The threshold expression of 
 F^2^ > 2sigma(F^2^) is used only for calculating R-factors(gt) etc. and is 
 not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement.  R-factors based 
 on F^2^ are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R- 
 factors based on ALL data will be even larger.
