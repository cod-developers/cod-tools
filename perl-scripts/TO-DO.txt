-- Check chf_validate: it seems that the missing loop-mandatory items
   _diffrn_refln_index_{h,k,l} go unnoticed...

-- Make cif_filter report symops that do not lead to determination of
   a spacegroup, as a warning, even if --keep-unrecognised-spacegroups
   option is in action.
-- Error in 'cif_validate': it hangs on error in first data_ block, even
   if more data_ blocks do exist in file being checked. This SHALL not
   happen - it must skip only current data_ block.
