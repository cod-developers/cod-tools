   Calculates minimal distance between atoms read from a cif file.

 -F, --add-filename
                     Add a filename field at the end of pairwise 
                     distance format lines.
 --no-add-filename,--do-not-add-filename
                     Do not add a filename field at the end of 
                     pairwise distance format lines (default).
 -M, --distance-matrix
                     Set distance matrix output format (default).
 -P, --pairwise-distance
                     Set pairwise distance output format.
 --include-null-distances
                     Include entries of null distance relationship between 
                     atoms from different disorder groups of the same 
                     disorder assembly in pairwise distances output format.
 --no-null-distances, --exclude-null-distances
                     Exclude entries of null distance relationship between 
                     atoms from different disorder groups of the same 
                     disorder assembly in pairwise distances output format
                     (default).
 --include-self-distances
                     Include entries of distances between symmetry-related 
                     instances of the same atom.
 --no-self-distances, --exclude-self-distances
                     Exclude entries of distances between symmetry-related
                     instances of the same atom (default).
 --include-unknown-types
                     Include entries containing atoms of undetermined 
                     chemical type. Atom type will be marked as 'UN'.
 --no-unknown-types, --exclude-unknown-atoms
                     Exclude entries containing atoms of undetermined 
                     chemical type (default).
 -l, --matrix-line-length "80"
                     Maximum length of an output line in distance 
                     matrix format (default 80).
 --format "%8.6f"
                     Use the specified format for distance matrix 
                     format printout (default "%-11.3f").
 --uniquify-atoms
                    Makes unique the labels of atoms (default).
 --no-uniquify-atoms
                    Does not make unique labels for atoms.
 -v, --verbose
                    Print additional information for each step of the script.
 -s, --silent, --quiet
                    Print no additional information.
 --help,--usage     Print a short usage message (this message) and exit.
