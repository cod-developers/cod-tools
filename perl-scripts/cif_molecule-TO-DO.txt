-- Pass isotropic B-factor and refinement flags into the output CIF file.
-- BUG in COD -- check and mark entries with incorrectly specifed disordered fragments?
++ Write _atom_site_type_symbol into output.
++ Check and fix detection of special positions.
++ Make printouts nicer, format generated tags in the same way as CIFTagPrint formats inherited tags
++ Add option to ignore close atom bumps.
++ Make audit creation a default
++ Make it faster: implement Garib's suggestion to use brick algorithm
++ Increase number of significant digits in coordinate outputs
-- !! Calculate sigmas of the output values
++ Fail (maybe optionally, but "on" by default) when errors are encountered
++ Add _data_source_... tags into the output files
++ Pass crystallographic quality tags (resolution, R-factors) into the output files
++ Pass crystallographic experimental tags (in addition to temperature: pressure, radiation type, etc...)
++ Check when atoms are too close and reporte such instances.
++ Rename ...R_factor... tags so that the output files do not pretend they have specifed R-factors against original data.
++ Exclude atoms with zero occupancy, with an option to include them; test on 2208311.cif
-+ Check why very deep recursion or empty molecules sometimes happen.
