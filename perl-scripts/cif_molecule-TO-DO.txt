++ Increase number of significant digits in coordinate outputs
-- !! Calculate sigmas of the output values
++ Fail (maybe optionally, but "on" by default) when errors are ancountered
++ Add _data_source_... tags into the output files
++ Pass crystallographic quality tags (resolution, R-factors) into the output files
++ Pass crystallographic experimental tags (in addition to temperature: pressure, radiation type, etc...)
-- Check when atoms are too close and reporte such instances.
++ Rename ...R_factor... tags so that the output files do not pretend they have specifed R-factors against original data.
-- Exclude atoms with zero occupancy, with an option to include them; test on 2208311.cif
-- Check why very deep recursion or empty molecules sometimes happen.
-- ... make it faster ...
