22 Apr to
22 Jul 2005: - Validation layer added; fixed some bugs; added
               case-insensitivity; some speedups; bumped version
               to 2.0

11 Nov 2004: - New licence terms added; attempt to wrap at 80
               characters when outputting.

11 Nov 2004: - Many changes to conform with Cif 1.1 spec: no longer
               recognise vertical tab or form feed; recognise save
               frames; global keyword gives error; no longer allow
               data values on input beginning with reserved keywords; no
               longer allow square brackets as first character in
               unquoted strings; maximum line length now 2048.

12 Oct 2004: - Added option to specify input line length

30 May 2003: - Removed references to old function "GetBlock"

27 May 2003: - Added a "get" method; fixed bug which produced 81 character
               lines

2  Sep 2002: - Moved import of types module to top level as Python 2.2
               complained

27 Jun 2002: - Fixed bugs with interpretation of quotes in strings as well as
               making sure strings with both double and single quotes are
               caught and output correctly

25 Jun 2002: - Fixed bug in regular expression for semicolon-delimited text

21 Jun 2002: - Implemented grammar parsing using Yapps2 instead of kjParsing, to
               avoid runtime errors on very large semicolon-delimited strings
               (reported by Sean Mooney)

27 Feb 2002: - Changed string output routines (printsection, __str__) to use the
               cStringIO module for increased speed.

 9 Jan 2002: - Added line number to long line error report; removed regsub module from
               import

 5 Dec 2001: - Added check of data type going into CIF, to make sure all can be deep
               copied.  Specifically, array type cannot be deep copied.

22 Nov 2001: - Improved error report information.  Syntax errors still poorly handled

 6 Nov 2001: - Attempted to fix exponential regular expression match behaviour 
              (pointed out by Ralf Grosse-Kunstleve)

             - Added open square bracket to normal match expressions, was often missing
              (may be related to previous problems)

24 Oct 2001: - Fixed bug in parsing semicolon delimited strings (could not handle sequential
               terminators)

 9 Oct 2001: - Initial release
