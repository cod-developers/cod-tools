     conditions of the CCP4 licence agreement as `Part 0' (Annex 2)
     software, which is version 2.1 of the GNU Lesser General Public
     Licence (LGPL) with the following additional clause:

        `You may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" to
        produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute
        that work under terms of your choice, provided that you give
        prominent notice with each copy of the work that the specified
        version of the Library is used in it, and that you include or
        provide public access to the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work. (i.e. If you make changes to the
        Library you must distribute those, but you do not need to
        distribute source or object code to those portions of the work
        not covered by this licence.)'

     Note that this clause grants an additional right and does not impose
     any additional restriction, and so does not affect compatibility
     with the GNU General Public Licence (GPL). If you wish to negotiate
     other terms, please contact the maintainer.
