/*
CCP4 resizable array implementation.

This defines an object and methods which looks just like a simple C
array, but can be resized at will without incurring excessive
overheads.

A pointer to the desired type is created. Array elements are accessed
from this pointer as normal. Other operations depend on macros which
extract the stored type from the type of the pointer.

The array is managed with a header, which is positioned before the
beginning of the array. The malloc'ed memory area starts at the
beginning of this header. However the pointer to the header is not
stored, but rather derived from the array pointer whenever it is
required.

Arrays have a size and a capacity. The size is the number of elements
in use, and the capacity is the number of elements available before a
new memory allocation is required. When new memory is required, an
excess is reqested to allow the array to grow further before
performing another malloc.

If the precise amount of memory is known, the capacity can be
controlled directly using the 'reserve' macro.

Example: to handle an array of type mytype:

\code
  int i;
  mytype x,y;
  mytype *array;

  ccp4array_new(array);

  ccp4array_append_n(array, x, 3);

  for ( i = 0; i < 3; i++ ) y = array[i];

  ccp4array_free(array);
\endcode
