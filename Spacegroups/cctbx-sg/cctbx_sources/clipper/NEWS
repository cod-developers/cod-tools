Status:

The API has been frozen for about 3 months now. However, new material
is being added to support application development. Any API changes
which are required will now, if possible, involve duplicating
existing APIs so that existing programs still work.

Optimisations are in the pipeline for reflection data NaN handling,
spacegroups, and xmaps.

New i/o classes will be made available for CCP4, cif, and other data
formats.
