  //! MTZ import/export parent class for clipper objects
  /*! This is the import/export class which can be linked to an mtz
    file and be used to transfer data into or out of a Clipper
    data structure.

    Note that to access the MTZ file efficiently, data reads and
    writes are deferred until the file is closed.

    \anchor MTZpaths \par MTZpaths: MTZ column specification

    Note that the specification of the MTZ column names is quite
    versatile. The MTZ crystal and dataset must be specified, although
    the wildcard '*' may replace a complete name. Several MTZ columns
    will correspond to a single datalist. This may be handled in two
    ways:
    -# A simple name. The corresponding MTZ columns will be named
    after the datalist name, a dot, the datalist type, a dot, and a
    type name for the indivudal column,
    i.e. /crystal/dataset/datalist.listtype.coltype This is the
    default Clipper naming convention for MTZ data.
    -# A comma separated list of MTZ column names enclosed in square
    brackets.  This allows MTZ data from legacy applications to be
    accessed. \n
    Thus, for example, an MTZPATH of
    \code
    native/CuKa/fsigfdata
    \endcode
    expands to MTZ column names of
    \code
    fsigfdata.F_sigF.F
    fsigfdata.F_sigF.sigF
    \endcode
    with a crystal called \c native and a dataset called \c CuKa. An MTZPATH of
    \code
    native/CuKa/[FP,SIGFP]
    \endcode
    expands to MTZ column names of
    \code
    FP
    SIGFP
    \endcode
    with a crystal called \c native and a dataset called \c CuKa.

    \archor MTZ_iotypes \par MTZ_iotypes: Import/export types

    For an HKL_data object to be imported or exported, an MTZ_iotype
    for that datatype must exist in the
    MTZ_iotypes_registry. MTZ_iotypes are defined for all the built-in
    datatypes. If you need to store a user defined type in an MTZ
    file, then register that type with the MTZ_iotypes_registry. */
