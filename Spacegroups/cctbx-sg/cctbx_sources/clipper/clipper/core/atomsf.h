  /*! The atomic scattering factor object is instantiated for each
    atom in turn, giving the atom parameters: position, element,
    occupancy and the isotropic or anisotropic U-value. (See
    clipper::Util for conversion from B-factors.). The methods of the
    class may then be called to return the scattering in reciprocal
    space or density in real space using either isotropic or
    anistropic models as required.

    If the atom only has an isotropic U, the faster isotropic methods
    will be used where available.

    This implementation uses the coefficients from Waasmaier & Kirfel
    (1995), Acta Cryst. A51, 416-431. The source data can be found at:
