  //! 2nd order resolution function evaluator
  /*! This is an automatic evaluator for arbitrary functions of HKL,
    most commonly used for evaluating a function of resolution (such a
    mean F^2 or sigmaa), although more general tasks including local
    scaling of reflections and anisotropic functions can also be
    handled. This form is for target functions which approach zero
    quadratically, e.g. least-squares targets.

    This version implements a naive Newton-Raphson minimiser, which
    only uses the gradient and curvature of the target function,
    ignoring its value. It is ideal for quadratic targets with linear
    basis functions.

    To evaluate a resolution function, this class must be provided
    with two objects:
     - The basis function (and gradients), which describes the value
     of the function for any reflection given a set of paramters.
     - The target function (and derivatives), which is used to determine
     the values of the basis function parameters.

    For example, the following code may be used to calculate a smooth
    scaling function to scale one set of data to another using an
    anisotropic Gaussian scaling function:
    \code
    // make data object
    clipper::HKL_info hkls;
    clipper::HKL_data<clipper::data32::F_sigF> fsig1( hkls );
    clipper::HKL_data<clipper::data32::F_sigF> fsig2( hkls );
    // INITIALISE THEM HERE!

    // calculate the scaling function
    std::vector<clipper::ftype> params( 7, 0.0 );  // initial parameters
    clipper::BasisFn_aniso_gaussian basisfn;       // aniso gaussian
    clipper::TargetFn_scaleF1F2<clipper::data32::F_sigF,clipper::data32::F_sigF>targetfn( fsig1, fsig2 );
    clipper::ResolutionFn_nonlinear rfn( hkls, basisfn, targetfn, params );

    // now scale the data
    clipper::HKL_info::HKL_reference_index ih;
    for ( ih = hkls.first(); !ih.last(); ih.next() )
      fsig1[ih].scale( sqrt( rfn.f(ih) ) );
    \endcode

    The most useful isotropic resolution function is the
    BasisFn_spline, since it is linear and provides a good fit to most
    data.
