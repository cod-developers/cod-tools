  //! Definition for a generic container Object
  /*! Container is a definition for a generic container object with a
    name, parents, and children. Any object that wants to be part of the
    tree simply subclasses this class. The class also implements search
    and move objects. The tree is navigate using unix-like pathnames. A
    recursive update method can be overridden to update content after
    altering the hierarchy.

    The top container in a tree is created by passing
    Container() as its parent.
