=head1 NAME

xml_export - Retrieve data for a project via the SF.net XML export facility

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<This program> provides a simple mechanism to download data from the
XML data export facility on SourceForge.net.  This utility is needed
(in place of a downloader like wget or curl) since authentication by
a project administrator is required to access the XML export facility.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

xml_export [options] > output_file

 OPTIONS
 --login                Login to the SourceForge.net site
 --logout               Logout of the SourceForge.net site
 --groupid=GROUPID      Group ID of the project whose data you wish to export

=head1 ERROR LEVELS

The following error levels are returned upon exit of this program:

 0 success

 1 failure: general (requested DocManager operation failed)

 2 failure: authentication failure

 3 failure: must --login before performing this operation

 4 failure: bad command-line option specified or variable setting problem

 5 failure: error in accessing/creating a file or directory

 6 failure: failed to enter requested input before timeout expired

=head1 AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE

The original version of B<this program> may be found in the materials
provided from the SourceForge.net Site Documentation project (sitedocs)
on the SourceForge.net site.  The latest version of this program
may be found in the CVS repository for the sitedocs project on
SourceForge.net.  The sitedocs project pages may be accessed at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sitedocs

=head1 SECURITY

For security-related information for this application, please review
the documentation provided for the adocman utility.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following are examples for using this program to export project
data via the XML data export facility on SourceForge.net.  It is presumed
that you have a valid SourceForge.net user account, which is listed as
a project administrator on the project in question.  This tool will
only work for project administrators.  The group ID for the project
may be derived from the URL for the Admin page for the project, or by
viewing the Project Admin page for the project (look for the text
"Your Group ID is: xxxxxx").

To login to the SourceForge.net site via the command-line:

  adocman --username=myusername --password=mypassword --login \
          --groupid=8675309

To login to the SourceForge.net site, and be prompted to enter your
password interactively:

  adocman --username=myusername --interactive --login --groupid=8675309

To perform an export (after logging-in):

  xml_export --groupid=8675309 > output.xml

To logout of SourceForge.net:

  adocman --logout

Additional capabilities (including the use of configuration files to
specify information that would otherwise be provided interactively
or on the command-line) are detailed in the documentation provided for
the adocman utility.

To obtain output for debugging a problem, perform the same command
as originally tested, but first add the --verbose flag, and determine
whether you are able to solve the issue on your own.  If the problem
persists, see the "SUPPORT AND BUGS" section, below.
