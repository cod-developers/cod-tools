# Guide to what this does with rsync:
#
#   --rsh=ssh          use ssh for the transfer
#   -l                 copy symlinks as symlinks
#   -p                 preserve permissions
#   -r                 recursive
#   -t                 preserve times
#   -z                 compress data
#   --stats            file transfer statistics
#   --exclude          exclude files matching the pattern
#   --delete           delete files that don't exist locally
#   --delete-excluded  delete files that match the --exclude patterns
#   --progress         show progress during the transfer
#   -v                 verbose
