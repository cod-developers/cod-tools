<para>

This appendix contains descriptions of all of the
construction variables that are <emphasis>potentially</emphasis>
available "out of the box" in this version of SCons.
Whether or not setting a construction variable
in a construction environment
will actually have an effect depends on
whether any of the Tools and/or Builders
that use the variable have been
included in the construction environment.

</para>

<para>

In this appendix, we have
appended the initial <envar>$</envar>
(dollar sign) to the beginning of each
variable name when it appears in the text,
but left off the dollar sign
in the left-hand column
where the name appears for each entry.
