  <para>

  We've already seen how you can use the &Alias;
  function to create a target named <literal>install</literal>:

  </para>

  <programlisting>
     env = Environment()
     hello = env.Program('hello.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
     env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')
  </programlisting>

  <para>

  You can then use this alias on the command line
  to tell &SCons; more naturally that you want to install files:

  </para>

  <screen>
     % <userinput>scons -Q install</userinput>
     cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
     cc -o hello hello.o
     Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"
  </screen>

  <para>

  Like other &Builder; methods, though,
  the &Alias; method returns an object
  representing the alias being built.
  You can then use this object as input to anothother &Builder;.
  This is especially useful if you use such an object
  as input to another call to the &Alias; &Builder;,
  allowing you to create a hierarchy
  of nested aliases:

  </para>

  <programlisting>
     env = Environment()
     p = env.Program('foo.c')
     l = env.Library('bar.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', p)
     env.Install('/usr/lib', l)
     ib = env.Alias('install-bin', '/usr/bin')
     il = env.Alias('install-lib', '/usr/lib')
     env.Alias('install', [ib, il])
  </programlisting>

  <para>

  This example defines separate <literal>install</literal>,
  <literal>install-bin</literal>,
  and <literal>install-lib</literal> aliases,
  allowing you finer control over what gets installed:

  </para>

  <screen>
     % <userinput>scons -Q install-bin</userinput>
     cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
     cc -o foo foo.o
     Install file: "foo" as "/usr/bin/foo"
     % <userinput>scons -Q install-lib</userinput>
     cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
     ar rc libbar.a bar.o
     ranlib libbar.a
     Install file: "libbar.a" as "/usr/lib/libbar.a"
     % <userinput>scons -Q -c /</userinput>
     Removed foo.o
     Removed foo
     Removed /usr/bin/foo
     Removed bar.o
     Removed libbar.a
     Removed /usr/lib/libbar.a
     % <userinput>scons -Q install</userinput>
     cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
     cc -o foo foo.o
     Install file: "foo" as "/usr/bin/foo"
     cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
     ar rc libbar.a bar.o
     ranlib libbar.a
     Install file: "libbar.a" as "/usr/lib/libbar.a"
  </screen>
