  First, many thanks to the great group of developers who dove in right
  from the beginning and have contributed the code and ideas to make
  &SCons; a success: Chad Austin, Charles Crain, Steve Leblanc, and
  Anthony Roach. Thanks also to those on the scons-devel mailing list
  who have contributed greatly to the discussion, notably including
  David Abrahams, Trent Mick, and Steven Shaw.

  &SCons; would not exist today without the pioneering work of Bob
  Sidebotham on the original &Cons; tool, and without Greg Wilson's
  having started the Software Carpentry contest.

  Thanks also to Peter Miller for: Aegis; the testing discipline that it
  enforces, without which creating a stable but flexible tool would be
  impossible; the "Recursive Make Considered Harmful" paper which led me
  to experiment with &Cons; in the first place.
