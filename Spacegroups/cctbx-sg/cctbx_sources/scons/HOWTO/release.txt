This document covers how to prepare major releases of SCons--that is,
releases numbered with X.Y format, such as 0.93, 1.0, etc.

If you need to prepare a specific subrelease (X.Y.Z, such as 0.94.1),
then see the document HOWTO/subrelease.txt.

Things to do to release a new X.Y version of SCons:

    Prepare the describe-the-release section for the announcements

        summarize changes from src/CHANGES.txt

        template is below, search for "describe-the-release"

        send this out for review while you get the rest of the
        release ready!

    Build and test candidate packages

        test on Linux

        test on Windows NT

            1) tar zxf scons-src-{version}.tar.gz
               cd scons-src-{version}
               python runtest.py -a

            2) tar zxf scons-{version}.tar.gz
               cd scons-{version}
               python setup.py install
               cd scons-src-{version}
               python runtest.py -a -X -x C:\Python20\scons.bat

            3) scons-{verson}.win32.exe
               cd scons-src-{version}
               python runtest.py -a -X -x C:\Python20\scons.bat

            4) mkdir temporary_directory
               cd temporary_directory
               tar zxf scons-local-{version}.tar.gz
               cd scons-src-{version}
               python runtest.py -a -x C:\temporary_directory\scons.py

        Check in any changes necessary to make everything work

        Pull down "Project => News"

        Click "Add new announcement"



    Announce to the following mailing lists (template below):

        scons-announce@lists.sourceforge.net
        scons-users@lists.sourceforge.net
        scons-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

            [right away]

        python-announce@python.org

            [right away, it's moderated and will take
            some time to get through]

        linux-announce@news.ornl.gov

            [right away, it's moderated and will take
            some time to get through]

        [optional] cons-discuss@gnu.org

            [only if it's a really big announcement,
            I said we wouldn't bug this list]

        python-list@python.org

            [wait until business hours so the announcement
            hits mailboxes while U.S. workers are active]

    Notify Gentoo Linux of the update

        For now, we will do this by entering a bug report, and
        attaching the files in build/gentoo to the report.  Go
        to:

            http://bugs.gentoo.org/

        This requires an account (based on your email address)
        and a certain amount of Bugzilla-based navigation,
        but nothing that's too difficult.

        This is just my best stab at a process that will work
        for Gentoo.  This process may change if the Gentoo
        developers come back and want something submitted in
        some other form.

    Notify www.cmtoday.com/contribute.html

        [This guy wants an announcement no more frequently than
        once a month, so save it for a future release if it's
        been too soon since the previous one.]

    Notify freshmeat.net

        [Wait until the morning so the announcement hits the
        main freshmeat.net page while people in the U.S. are
        awake and working]

ABOUT SCONS

Distinctive features of SCons include:

  - a global view of all dependencies; no multiple passes to get
    everything built properly
  - configuration files are Python scripts, allowing the full use of a
    real scripting language to solve difficult build problems
  - a modular architecture allows the SCons Build Engine to be
    embedded in other Python software
  - the ability to scan files for implicit dependencies (#include files);
  - improved parallel build (-j) support that provides consistent
    build speedup regardless of source tree layout
  - use of MD5 signatures to decide if a file has really changed; no
    need to "touch" files to fool make that something is up-to-date
  - easily extensible through user-defined Builder and Scanner objects
  - build actions can be Python code, as well as external commands

An scons-users mailing list is available for those interested in getting
started using SCons.  You can subscribe at:

        http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/scons-users

Alternatively, we invite you to subscribe to the low-volume
scons-announce mailing list to receive notification when new versions of
SCons become available:

        http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/scons-announce
