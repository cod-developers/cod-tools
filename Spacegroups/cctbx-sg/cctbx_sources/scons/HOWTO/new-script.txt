Steps for adding a new script/utility to the SCons packages.  Assume
that you're creating a new man page, too.  In the template steps
below, "newscript" is the name of the new script/utility being added.

    New files:

        doc/man/newscript.1

            New man page; use an existing one as a template.

        src/script/newscript.py

            The new script itself.

        test/*.py

            Appropriate tests for the new script.

    Modified files:

        SConstruct

            In the "scons_script" package description:

                Add "newscript" : "newscript.py" to the "filemap"
                dictionary.

            In the "scons" package description:

                Add "newscript.1" to the "files" list.

                Add "newscript.1" : "../doc/man/newscript.1" to the
                "filemap" dictionary.

            Add "newscript" to the scripts[] list

        debian/rules

            Add:

                rm -f debian/scons/usr/bin/newscript
                cp build/scripts/newscript debian/scons/user/bin/newscript
                sed '1s|.*|#!/usr/bin/python2.1|' build/scripts/newscript > debian/scons/user/bin/newscript
                chmod +x debian/scons/user/bin/newscript

                rm -f debian/scons/usr/share/man/man1/newscript.1
                cp newscript.1 debian/scons/user/share/man/man1/

        doc/SConscript

            Add "newscript" to man_page_list[]

        gentoo/scons.ebuild.in

            Add "doman newscript.1"

        rpm/scons.spec.in

            Add "gzip -c newscript.1" > $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr/man/man1/newscript.1.gz

            Add "%doc /usr/man/man1/newscript.1.gz"

        src/CHANGES.txt

            Document the addition of the new script.

        src/script/MANIFEST.in

            Add a line:  "newscript"

        src/setup.py
