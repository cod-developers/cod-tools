<cvar name="RPATH">
<summary>
A list of paths to search for shared libraries when running programs.
Currently only used in the GNU (gnulink),
IRIX (sgilink) and Sun (sunlink) linkers.
Ignored on platforms and toolchains that don't support it.
Note that the paths added to RPATH
are not transformed by
&scons;
in any way:  if you want an absolute
path, you must make it absolute yourself.

<cvar name="_RPATH">
<summary>
An automatically-generated construction variable
containing the rpath flags to be used when linking
a program with shared libraries.
The value of &cv-_RPATH; is created
by appending &cv-RPATHPREFIX; and &cv-RPATHSUFFIX;
to the beginning and end
of each directory in &cv-RPATH;.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="RPATHPREFIX">
<summary>
The prefix used to specify a directory to be searched for
shared libraries when running programs.
This will be appended to the beginning of each directory
in the &cv-RPATH; construction variable
when the &cv-_RPATH; variable is automatically generated.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="RPATHSUFFIX">
<summary>
The suffix used to specify a directory to be searched for
shared libraries when running programs.
This will be appended to the end of each directory
in the &cv-RPATH; construction variable
when the &cv-_RPATH; variable is automatically generated.
