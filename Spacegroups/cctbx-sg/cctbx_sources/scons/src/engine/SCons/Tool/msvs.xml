<builder name ="MSVSProject">
<summary>
Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio project file,
and by default builds a solution file as well.

This builds a Visual Studio project file, based on the version of
Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed version,
or the version specified by
&cv-link-MSVS_VERSION;
in the Environment constructor).
For Visual Studio 6, it will generate a
<filename>.dsp</filename>
file.
For Visual Studio 7 (.NET) and later versions, it will generate a
<filename>.vcproj</filename>
file.

By default,
this also generates a solution file
for the specified project,
a
<filename>.dsw</filename>
file for Visual Studio 6
or a
<filename>.sln</filename>
file for Visual Studio 7 (.NET).
This behavior may be disabled by specifying
<literal>auto_build_solution=0</literal>
when you call
&b-MSVSProject;,
in which case you presumably want to
build the solution file(s)
by calling the
&b-MSVSSolution;
Builder (see below).

It takes several lists of filenames to be placed into the project
file.
These are currently limited to
<literal>srcs</literal>,
<literal>incs</literal>,
<literal>localincs</literal>,
<literal>resources</literal>,
and
<literal>misc</literal>.
These are pretty self-explanatory, but it should be noted that these
lists are added to the &cv-link-SOURCES; construction variable as strings,
NOT as SCons File Nodes.  This is because they represent file
names to be added to the project file, not the source files used to
build the project file.

The above filename lists are all optional,
although at least one must be specified
for the resulting project file to be non-empty.

In addition to the above lists of values,
the following values may be specified:

<literal>target</literal>:
The name of the target
<filename>.dsp</filename>
or
<filename>.vcproj</filename>
file.
The correct
suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used,
but the
&cv-link-MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX;
construction variable
will be defined to the correct value (see example below).

<literal>variant</literal>:
The name of this particular variant.
For Visual Studio 7 projects,
this can also be a list of variant names.
These are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really
can be anything you want.
For Visual Studio 7 projects,
they may also specify a target platform
separated from the variant name by a
<literal>|</literal>
(vertical pipe)
character:
<literal>Debug|Xbox</literal>.
The default target platform is Win32.
Multiple calls to
&b-MSVSProject;
with different variants are allowed;
all variants will be added to the project file with their appropriate
build targets and sources.

<literal>buildtarget</literal>:
An optional string, node, or list of strings or nodes
(one per build variant), to tell the Visual Studio debugger
what output target to use in what build variant.
The number of
<literal>buildtarget</literal>
entries must match the number of
<literal>variant</literal>
entries.

<literal>runfile</literal>:
The name of the file that Visual Studio 7 and later
will run and debug.
This appears as the value of the
<literal>Output</literal>
field in the resutling Visual Studio project file.
If this is not specified,
the default is the same as the specified
<literal>buildtarget</literal>
value.

Example usage:

<example>
barsrcs = ['bar.cpp'],
barincs = ['bar.h'],
barlocalincs = ['StdAfx.h']
barresources = ['bar.rc','resource.h']
barmisc = ['bar_readme.txt']

dll = env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar.dll',
                        source = barsrcs)

env.MSVSProject(target = 'Bar' + env['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX'],
                srcs = barsrcs,
                incs = barincs,
                localincs = barlocalincs,
                resources = barresources,
                misc = barmisc,
                buildtarget = dll,
                variant = 'Release')
</example>
</summary>
</builder>

<builder name ="MSVSSolution">
<summary>
Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio solution file.

This builds a Visual Studio solution file,
based on the version of Visual Studio that is configured
(either the latest installed version,
or the version specified by
&cv-link-MSVS_VERSION;
in the construction environment).
For Visual Studio 6, it will generate a
<filename>.dsw</filename>
file.
For Visual Studio 7 (.NET), it will
generate a
<filename>.sln</filename>
file.

The following values must be specified:

<literal>target</literal>:
The name of the target .dsw or .sln file.  The correct
suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but the value
&cv-link-MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX;
will be defined to the correct value (see example below).

<literal>variant</literal>:
The name of this particular variant, or a list of variant
names (the latter is only supported for MSVS 7 solutions). These are
typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really can be anything
you want. For MSVS 7 they may also specify target platform, like this
"Debug|Xbox". Default platform is Win32.

<literal>projects</literal>:
A list of project file names, or Project nodes returned by calls to the
&b-MSVSProject;
Builder,
to be placed into the solution file.
It should be noted that these file names are NOT added to the $SOURCES
environment variable in form of files, but rather as strings.   This
is because they represent file names to be added to the solution file,
not the source files used to build the solution file.

(NOTE: Currently only one project is supported per solution.)

Example Usage:

<example>
env.MSVSSolution(target = 'Bar' + env['MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX'],
                 projects = ['bar' + env['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX']],
                 variant = 'Release')
</example>

<cvar name="MSVS">
<summary>
When the Microsoft Visual Studio tools are initialized, they set up
this dictionary with the following keys:

<envar>VERSION</envar>:
the version of MSVS being used (can be set via
MSVS_VERSION)

<envar>VERSIONS</envar>:
the available versions of MSVS installed

<envar>VCINSTALLDIR</envar>:
installed directory of Visual C++

<envar>VSINSTALLDIR</envar>:
installed directory of Visual Studio

<envar>FRAMEWORKDIR</envar>:
installed directory of the .NET framework

<envar>FRAMEWORKVERSIONS</envar>:
list of installed versions of the .NET framework, sorted latest to oldest.

<envar>FRAMEWORKVERSION</envar>:
latest installed version of the .NET framework

<envar>FRAMEWORKSDKDIR</envar>:
installed location of the .NET SDK.

<envar>PLATFORMSDKDIR</envar>:
installed location of the Platform SDK.

<envar>PLATFORMSDK_MODULES</envar>:
dictionary of installed Platform SDK modules,
where the dictionary keys are keywords for the various modules, and
the values are 2-tuples where the first is the release date, and the
second is the version number.

If a value isn't set, it wasn't available in the registry.

</cvar>

<cvar name="MSVS_IGNORE_IDE_PATHS">
<summary>
Tells the MS Visual Studio tools to use minimal INCLUDE, LIB, and PATH settings,
instead of the settings from the IDE.

For Visual Studio, SCons will (by default) automatically determine
where MSVS is installed, and use the LIB, INCLUDE, and PATH variables
set by the IDE.  You can override this behavior by setting these
variables after Environment initialization, or by setting
<envar>MSVS_IGNORE_IDE_PATHS = 1</envar>
in the Environment initialization.
Specifying this will not leave these unset, but will set them to a
minimal set of paths needed to run the tools successfully.

For VS6, the mininimal set is:
<example>
   INCLUDE:'&lt;VSDir&gt;\VC98\ATL\include;&lt;VSDir&gt;\VC98\MFC\include;&lt;VSDir&gt;\VC98\include'
   LIB:'&lt;VSDir&gt;\VC98\MFC\lib;&lt;VSDir&gt;\VC98\lib'
   PATH:'&lt;VSDir&gt;\Common\MSDev98\bin;&lt;VSDir&gt;\VC98\bin'
</example>
For VS7, it is:
<example>
   INCLUDE:'&lt;VSDir&gt;\Vc7\atlmfc\include;&lt;VSDir&gt;\Vc7\include'
   LIB:'&lt;VSDir&gt;\Vc7\atlmfc\lib;&lt;VSDir&gt;\Vc7\lib'
   PATH:'&lt;VSDir&gt;\Common7\Tools\bin;&lt;VSDir&gt;\Common7\Tools;&lt;VSDir&gt;\Vc7\bin'
</example>

Where '&lt;VSDir&gt;' is the installed location of Visual Studio.

<cvar name="MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS">
<summary>
Tells the MS Visual Studio tool(s) to use
the MFC directories in its default paths
for compiling and linking.
The &cv-MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS; variable has no effect if the
<envar>INCLUDE</envar>
or
<envar>LIB</envar>
environment variables are set explictly.

Under Visual Studio version 6,
setting
&cv-MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS;
to a non-zero value
adds the
<filename>ATL\include</filename>
and
<filename>MFC\include</filename>
directories to
the default
<envar>INCLUDE</envar>
external environment variable,
and adds the
<filename>MFC\lib</filename>
directory to
the default
<envar>LIB</envar>
external environment variable.

Under Visual Studio version 7,
setting
&cv-MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS;
to a non-zero value
adds the
<filename>atlmfc\include</filename>
directory to the default
<envar>INCLUDE</envar>
external environment variable,
and adds the
<filename>atlmfc\lib</filename>
directory to the default
<envar>LIB</envar>
external environment variable.

Under Visual Studio version 8,
setting
&cv-MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS;

<filename>atl</filename>
subdirectories of the
<envar>PLATFORMSDKDIR</envar>
are added to the default value of the
<envar>INCLUDE</envar>
external environment variable,
and the default value of the
<envar>LIB</envar>
external environment variable is left untouched.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="MSVS_VERSION">
<summary>
Sets the preferred version of MSVS to use.

SCons will (by default) select the latest version of MSVS
installed on your machine.
So, if you have version 6 and version 7 (MSVS .NET) installed,
it will prefer version 7.
You can override this by
specifying the
<envar>MSVS_VERSION</envar>
variable in the Environment initialization, setting it to the
appropriate version ('6.0' or '7.0', for example).
If the given version isn't installed, tool initialization will fail.
