<cvar name ="_concat">
<summary>
A function used to produce variables like &cv-_CPPINCFLAGS;. It takes
four or five
arguments: a prefix to concatenate onto each element, a list of
elements, a suffix to concatenate onto each element, an environment
for variable interpolation, and an optional function that will be
called to transform the list before concatenation.

<example>
env['_CPPINCFLAGS'] = '$( ${_concat(INCPREFIX, CPPPATH, INCSUFFIX, __env__, RDirs)} $)',
</example>
</summary>

<cvar name="CONFIGUREDIR">
<summary>
The name of the directory in which
Configure context test files are written.
The default is
<filename>.sconf_temp</filename>
in the top-level directory
containing the
<filename>SConstruct</filename>
file.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CONFIGURELOG">
<summary>
The name of the Configure context log file.
The default is
<filename>config.log</filename>
in the top-level directory
containing the
<filename>SConstruct</filename>

<cvar name="_CPPDEFFLAGS">
<summary>
An automatically-generated construction variable
containing the C preprocessor command-line options
to define values.
The value of &cv-_CPPDEFFLAGS; is created
by appending &cv-CPPDEFPREFIX; and &cv-CPPDEFSUFFIX;
to the beginning and end
of each directory in &cv-CPPDEFINES;.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CPPDEFINES">
<summary>
A platform independent specification of C preprocessor definitions.
The definitions will be added to command lines
through the automatically-generated
&cv-_CPPDEFFLAGS; construction variable (see above),
which is constructed according to
the type of value of &cv-CPPDEFINES;:

If &cv-CPPDEFINES; is a string,
the values of the
&cv-CPPDEFPREFIX; and &cv-CPPDEFSUFFIX;
construction variables
will be added to the beginning and end.

<example>
# Will add -Dxyz to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /Dxyz to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES='xyz')
</example>

If &cv-CPPDEFINES; is a list,
the values of the
&cv-CPPDEFPREFIX; and &cv-CPPDEFSUFFIX;
construction variables
will be appended to the beginning and end
of each element in the list.
If any element is a list or tuple,
then the first item is the name being
defined and the second item is its value:

<example>
# Will add -DB=2 -DA to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DB=2 /DA to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('B', 2), 'A'])
</example>

If &cv-CPPDEFINES; is a dictionary,
the values of the
&cv-CPPDEFPREFIX; and &cv-CPPDEFSUFFIX;
construction variables
will be appended to the beginning and end
of each item from the dictionary.
The key of each dictionary item
is a name being defined
to the dictionary item's corresponding value;
if the value is
<literal>None</literal>,
then the name is defined without an explicit value.
Note that the resulting flags are sorted by keyword
to ensure that the order of the options on the
command line is consistent each time
&scons;
is run.

<example>
# Will add -DA -DB=2 to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DA /DB=2 to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES={'B':2, 'A':None})
</example>
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CPPDEFPREFIX">
<summary>
The prefix used to specify preprocessor definitions
on the C compiler command line.
This will be appended to the beginning of each definition
in the &cv-CPPDEFINES; construction variable
when the &cv-_CPPDEFFLAGS; variable is automatically generated.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CPPDEFSUFFIX">
<summary>
The suffix used to specify preprocessor definitions
on the C compiler command line.
This will be appended to the end of each definition
in the &cv-CPPDEFINES; construction variable
when the &cv-_CPPDEFFLAGS; variable is automatically generated.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="_CPPINCFLAGS">
<summary>
An automatically-generated construction variable
containing the C preprocessor command-line options
for specifying directories to be searched for include files.
The value of &cv-_CPPINCFLAGS; is created
by appending &cv-INCPREFIX; and &cv-INCSUFFIX;
to the beginning and end
of each directory in &cv-CPPPATH;.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CPPPATH">
<summary>
The list of directories that the C preprocessor will search for include
directories. The C/C++ implicit dependency scanner will search these
directories for include files. Don't explicitly put include directory
arguments in CCFLAGS or CXXFLAGS because the result will be non-portable
and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner. Note:
directory names in CPPPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
directory when they are used in a command. To force
&scons;
to look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:

<example>
env = Environment(CPPPATH='#/include')
</example>

The directory look-up can also be forced using the
&Dir;()
function:

<example>
include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(CPPPATH=include)
</example>

The directory list will be added to command lines
through the automatically-generated
&cv-_CPPINCFLAGS;
construction variable,
which is constructed by
appending the values of the
&cv-INCPREFIX; and &cv-INCSUFFIX;
construction variables
to the beginning and end
of each directory in &cv-CPPPATH;.
Any command lines you define that need
the CPPPATH directory list should
include &cv-_CPPINCFLAGS;:

<example>
env = Environment(CCCOM="my_compiler $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")
</example>

when the &cv-_LIBDIRFLAGS; variable is automatically generated.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="LIBDIRSUFFIX">
<summary>
The suffix used to specify a library directory on the linker command line.
This will be appended to the end of each directory
in the &cv-LIBPATH; construction variable
when the &cv-_LIBDIRFLAGS; variable is automatically generated.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="_LIBFLAGS">
<summary>
An automatically-generated construction variable
containing the linker command-line options
for specifying libraries to be linked with the resulting target.

when the &cv-_LIBFLAGS; variable is automatically generated.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="LIBPATH">
<summary>
The list of directories that will be searched for libraries.
The implicit dependency scanner will search these
directories for include files. Don't explicitly put include directory
arguments in &cv-LINKFLAGS; or &cv-SHLINKFLAGS;
because the result will be non-portable
and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner. Note:
directory names in LIBPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
directory when they are used in a command. To force
&scons;
to look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:

<example>
env = Environment(LIBPATH='#/libs')
</example>

The directory look-up can also be forced using the
&Dir;()
function:

<example>
libs = Dir('libs')
env = Environment(LIBPATH=libs)
</example>

The directory list will be added to command lines
through the automatically-generated
&cv-_LIBDIRFLAGS;
construction variable,
which is constructed by
appending the values of the
&cv-LIBDIRPREFIX; and &cv-LIBDIRSUFFIX;
construction variables
to the beginning and end
of each directory in &cv-LIBPATH;.
Any command lines you define that need
the LIBPATH directory list should
include &cv-_LIBDIRFLAGS;:

<example>
env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE")
</example>
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="LIBS">
<summary>
A list of one or more libraries
that will be linked with
any executable programs
created by this environment.

The library list will be added to command lines
through the automatically-generated
&cv-_LIBFLAGS;
construction variable,
which is constructed by
appending the values of the
&cv-LIBLINKPREFIX; and &cv-LIBLINKSUFFIX;
construction variables
to the beginning and end
of each filename in &cv-LIBS;.
Any command lines you define that need
the LIBS library list should
include &cv-_LIBFLAGS;:

<example>
env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE")
</example>

If you add a
File
object to the
&cv-LIBS;
list, the name of that file will be added to
&cv-_LIBFLAGS;,
and thus the link line, as is, without
&cv-LIBLINKPREFIX;
or
&cv-LIBLINKSUFFIX;.
For example:

<example>
env.Append(LIBS=File('/tmp/mylib.so'))
</example>

In all cases, scons will add dependencies from the executable program to
all the libraries in this list.
