# > What we are interested in is a standard crystallographic library that we
# > can call from Jython as well as data analysis packages such as
# > Matlab/Mathematica. The kinds of things we would like would include:
#
# General note: the cctbx is a Python-based library with C++ extensions.
# The extensions are essential for all crystallographic algorithms.
# I've never tested how this plays with Jython.
#
# > Low-level:
# > Generate space groups (in matrix/vector form) based on spacegroup number
# > (names are a pain)
# > Generate conditions for allowed reflections etc
# > Generate point group of space group in matrix form
# > Generate point-group matrices for given coordinate
# > Access databases for form factors, anomalous scattering factors,
#
# See the attached example script.
# This script should work with one of the bundles from here:
#
#   http://cci.lbl.gov/cctbx_build/
#
# If you can, start with a binary bundle. These install in seconds.
# If you start from sources it may take 30 minutes or more.
#
# > Higher level:
# > Read/(write?) CIF file
#
# PyCifRW is included in the cctbx bundles. See the PyCifRW documentation:
